# OOP py

This is a Python project that simulates a simple robot management system. The system allows you to create and manage robots, move them, and display their status. Additionally, it includes utility functions for resetting robot positions, checking robot status, and finding robots by name.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several Python files:

- **`manager.py`**: Contains the `RobotManager` class to manage the robots (add, remove, display, and filter robots).
- **`test.py`**: Contains unit tests for the `Robot`, `RobotManager`, and utility functions.
- **`utils.py`**: Contains the `Robot` class and utility functions like resetting robot positions and checking status.
- **`main.py`**: The main entry point to run the application, demonstrating the functionality of the `RobotManager` and `Robot` classes.

## Installation

To use this project, you need Python 3.x installed on your machine. No external dependencies are required.
